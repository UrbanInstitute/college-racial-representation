College enrollment gaps between racial and ethnic groups persist, driven by <a href="https://next50.urban.org/question/structural-racism">structural racism</a>, other systemic barriers, and policies and practices that often aren’t designed to help underrepresented students access high-quality postsecondary education opportunities. These gaps can <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23618">perpetuate earnings and wealth disparities</a> between racial and ethnic groups. Most colleges can easily find a diverse group of potential students, but many schools have student bodies that don’t look like the pool of potential students they could enroll. We look at two-and four-year colleges and universities to see which racial and ethnic groups are over-and underrepresented based on the population of the school’s market. This market area varies depending on the type of school and the distance current students are willing to travel to attend that college. Exploring these trends can inform efforts to expand access to postsecondary education options that improve people’s lives, especially for those who have historically and systematically been denied those opportunities.</p></div></div><div id="scenarios"><p class="scenario">Data Highlights</p><div class="scenario clickable" id="scenario1"><img src="images/icon-1.png"><br><span>White students becoming less overrepresented at highly selective public colleges</span></div><div class="scenario clickable" id="scenario2"><img src="images/icon-2.png"><br><span>Hispanic representation rising in most college sectors in California</span></div><div class="scenario clickable" id="scenario3"><img src="images/icon-3.png"><br><span>Black representation plummets at Wayne State University</span></div><div class="clear"></div></div><div id="geography-selection"><label for="national"><input type="radio" class="geography-choices n-radio" name="geography-choice" value="national" checked="checked"> <span>National</span></label> <label for="state"><input type="radio" class="geography-choices n-radio" name="geography-choice" value="state"> <span>State</span></label> <label for="school"><input type="radio" class="geography-choices n-radio" name="geography-choice" value="school"> <span>School</span></label></div><div id="options-panel"><select id="dropdown"></select><div id="school-chooser"><p>College</p><input type="" name="" id="school-lookup" class="ui-autocomplete-input" autocomplete="off"></div><span id="time-selection"><span class="time-selector bar selected" value="single-year-bar"><img src="images/barIcon.png"> <span>Single year</span> </span><span class="time-selector line" value="race-ethnicities-as-lines"><img src="images/lineIcon.png"> <span>By sector</span> </span><span class="time-selector line" value="sectors-as-lines"><img src="images/lineIcon.png"> <span>By race</span></span><div id="year-selector"><label for="year">Year:</label> <input type="text" id="year-box" name="year" required minlength="4" maxlength="4" size="10"> <input id="year-input" type="submit" value="Submit" name="year"><br></div><div id="first-dynamic-menu"></div><div id="second-dynamic-menu"></div></span></div><div id="chart-area-container"><div id="chart-frame"><div id="single-year-container" class="chart-div"><h4 class="chart-title">Average Representation at US Colleges in <span>2017</span></h4><div class="legend"></div></div><div id="multi-year-by-race-container" class="chart-div"><h4 class="chart-title">Average Representation at <span>Public Nonselective</span> US Colleges<br>over Time, by Race or Ethnicity</h4><div class="legend"></div></div><div id="multi-year-by-sector-container" class="chart-div"><h4 class="chart-title">Average <span>Hispanic</span> Representation at US Colleges over Time,<br>by College Sector</h4><div class="legend"></div></div><div id="one-school-all-races" class="chart-div"><h4 class="chart-title">Representation at <span>Alabama A & M University</span> over Time</h4><div class="legend"></div></div><div id="multiple-schools" class="chart-div"><h4 class="chart-title">Represenation at <span>Sector</span> <span>State name</span> Colleges over Time</h4><div class="legend"></div></div></div></div><div class="clear"></div></div><footer><div id="about-the-data" class="content"><h4>About the data</h4><p>To develop our representation measure, we determined the racial composition of a college’s enrollment and the racial composition of a college’s market. Data on college enrollment came from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). We obtained the IPEDS files for 2009through 2017 using the <a href="https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer/">Urban Institute’s Education Data Portal</a>.</p><p>To figure out the potential pool of students in a college’s market, we first tracked the commuting distance that enrolled students traveled. We observed the distribution of commuting distance by students that attend each type of institution using the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study for 2015–16. These data summarize the distance from home that students are typically willing to travel to attend a college. We defined a college’s market radius using the 75th percentile of the distribution of commuting distance for each college leveland urbanicity type.</p><p>We then used data from the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey five-year estimates at the census tract level to determine the demographics of people living within a college’s market. We used the population of 18-to-24-year-olds for potential four-year college students, and we used the population of 18-to-54-year-olds for potential two-year community college students. These age groups vary by institution level because nontraditional students are more likely to enroll in two-year colleges.</p><p>Our college representation measure is defined as the difference in a racial or ethnic group’s enrollment share at a college and its share of the college’s market population. If this difference is zero,the college’s enrollment share for a given group perfectly represents that group’s share of the population in the college’s market. If the measure is positive, a group is overrepresented in its enrollment share at the college. If the measure is negative, that group is underrepresented at the college.</p><p>Our national averages measure the average representativeness of colleges in the nation and are weighted by total college enrollment. Our state average estimates use a similar logic.</p><p>Our dataset does not include private nonprofit two-year colleges, colleges that focus on distance education, colleges whose enrollment drops below 30 students during the study period, and colleges that appear less than five years in the IPEDS data study period. We also exclude the race or ethnicity group “other” because of concerns about interpretation and because our data sources may define this group differently.</p><p>We use the racial and ethnic terms listed in our data sources. We recognize the limitations of these choices, especially in surveys that ask people to self-report with a limited pool of options.</p><h4>Project credits</h4><div class="urbanstatement">This feature was funded by the Joyce Foundation and the Lumina Foundation.
